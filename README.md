# About me:
My name is Ali. I'm a reseracher in the field of complexity and my main interest is mathematical and computational modeling of complex phenomenas. I study math, logic, theoretical computer science and computer engineering and off course, Data science. I also have a background in formal philosophy.

Here i mostly share my notes on the abov topics but sometimes... I may share some artworks (Music and graphics) that are made using computer and math.
