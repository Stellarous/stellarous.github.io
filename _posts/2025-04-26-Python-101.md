### Arithmetic operators:

```python
3 + 2 #addition
3 - 2 #subtraction
2 * 3 #multiplication
3 / 3 # devision

2 ** 3 #exponential (power)
```

Type of numbers in python:
- integers: whole numbers
- floating-point numbers: numbers with a decimal point.

Expressions: A collection of operators and numbers.
```python
(2 + 3) ** 4
```

python follows the order of operations in arithmetic: exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.

### Arithmetic functions:
```python
round(8.7) #takes a floating-point number and round it off to the nearest whole number
>> result: 9

abs(48) #compute the absolute value of a number
```

When we use functions in programming, we say we are **call** function. and the expression we use is a **function call**. When calling a function, parentheses is necessary. 

`SyntaxError`: means there is a problem with the structure of an expression.

### String:
sequence of letters:
```python
'hello'
"hello"
"hello's"
```

Concatenation: using `+` to add two strings together:
```python
'hello' + 'world' + 'and' + "beyond's"
```

Using `*` (multiplication operator) also works with strings, it makes copies of a string and concatenate them: 
```python
'hello' * 4
>> result: 'hello hello hello hello'
```

Other arithmetic operators don't work with string.

```python
len('hello') #a function that computes the lenght of s string
```

### Values and types:
 
 kind of value is called a type. Every value has a type—or we sometimes say it “belongs to” a type.

list of python types:
- int
- float
- string

```python
type(2) #a function to return the type of any value.
>> result: int

type(4.5)
>> result: float
```

the types `int`, `float` and `str` can be used as functions:
```python
int(2.0) #a function to return integer
>> result: 2

int('123') #a function to return integer
>> result: 123

float(42) #a function to return floating point
>> result: 42.0

str(42) #a function to return string
>> result: '42'
```

Note:
```python
type(123)
>> result: int

type('123')
>> result: str

123 + '123'
>> result: TypeError
```

`TypeError`: the value in the expression (called operands), have the wrong type.

```python
1,000,000
>> result: (1, 0, 0)

1_000_000
>> result: 1000000
```
